What happens when you combine **Web Workers**, **TensorFlow.js edge-AI**, and **React** into a single, aggressively optimized camera app? You get **ASSCAM**. 

ASSCAM is a "Floating Glass Studio" that instantly converts your live webcam feed into gorgeous, stylized typography art. There's no backend processing, no privacy-invading cloud APIs. Everything—from the neural-net face detection to the real-time contrast heuristics—runs instantly on your local GPU via WebGL.

<br/>

## ✨ The Features That Matter

- 🧠 **Smart Auto-Tune (TensorFlow.js Edge AI)**: Stop playing with sliders. ASSCAM runs Google's BlazeFace neural network and custom luminance heuristics entirely in the background. It detects if you're taking a portrait, sitting in a dark room, or looking at a flat wall, and instantly recalibrates the exposure, character set, and contrast in real time.
- ⚡ **Zero-Lag Web Worker Engine**: Rendering 15,000 text characters at 60fps usually destroys the main thread. ASSCAM dumps the heavy lifting (grayscale conversion, Sobel edge-detection, string mapping) into an asynchronous Web Worker, leaving the UI completely buttery smooth.
- 💎 **Floating Glassmorphic Studio UI**: Built entirely with incredibly polished custom CSS. Dynamic ambient background blobs, Apple-grade frosted glass, intuitive chunky sliders, and segmented tab ribbons. A masterclass in frontend obsession.
- 🎨 **10+ Studio Render Modes**: Classic Hacker Green, Duotone, Glitch, Neon, Heatmap, or pure Threshold. Adjust weights, typography, fonts, and kerning dynamically.

## 🛠️ The Engineering (For the Nerds)

If you're reading this, you probably care about how things are built. I built ASSCAM to flex a critical concept: **The browser is an operating system.**

* **Tech Stack**: React 18, Vite, raw CSS (for ultimate customization), and `@tensorflow-models/blazeface`. 
* **The Frame Pipeline**: 
  1. `<video>` tag captures the camera feed secretly in the background.
  2. Every animation frame, the video is drawn to an offscreen Canvas.
  3. The `ImageData` buffer is transferred asynchronously to a `worker.js` thread.
  4. The worker applies a custom Matrix multiplication to find luminance, passes a Sobel filter convolution for edge density, maps values to ASCII ramps, and returns a raw string grid. 
  5. React paints the strings perfectly into the DOM.
* **The AI Layer**: The `useAutoTune` hook reads frames on a delayed loop. If it detects a face with >90% confidence using TF.js, it overrides user controls with the optimal studio lighting preset.

## 👋 Meet the Mind Behind It

Hi, I'm **Manamnath Tiwari**. 

I’m a relentless software engineer and creative technologist who believes that code shouldn't just "function"—it should perform beautifully under the hood, and look breathtaking on the screen. 

ASSCAM is just a glimpse of how I approach problem-solving: aggressively modern tech stacks, unapologetic performance optimization, and an absolute obsession with user experience. 

**I don't just write apps. I build experiences.**

If you are building something ambitious, attempting to solve a heavy computational problem on the frontend, or looking for an engineer who gives a damn about the details—we should talk.
